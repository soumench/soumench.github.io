        According to legends, Shah Jahan was so sad after her death that he ordered the court to mourn for two years. Later, Shah Jahan started to build the world's most beautiful monument beside the river Yamuna in memory of his beloved wife. It took 22 years and 22,000 workers to build the monument. The Taj Mahal was built entirely out of white marble. This white marble was brought in from all over Asia. When Shah Jahan died in 1666, his body was placed next to the grave of Mumtaz Mahal. This magnificent monument came to be known as the Taj Mahal. It is now considered to be one among the seven wonders of the World. Grandfather paused for a moment. 'Well, I have told you quite a lot today. Will this be helpful enough?" "Oh yes, now I can easily write a paragraph on the Taj Mahal," said Tarun happily.
