        "Once upon a time there lived a prince named Khurram. He was the son of Jehangir, and the grandson of Akbar the Great. 
            </p>
            <p>
            One day Khurram went to the Meena Bazaar with his friends. There he caught a glimpse of an extremely beautiful girl who was selling silk and glass beads. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The girl was Arjumand Banu Begum. She was born in a family of a Persian nobility. 
            </p>
            <p>
            After meeting her, Khurram went back to his father and said that he wanted to marry her. Khurram married Arjumand Banu Begum in 1612, five years after their first meeting." 
            </p>
            <p>
            At this point Tarun stopped his grandfather : "But, grandfather, I don't want to hear the story of prince Khurram. I want to know about the Taj Mahal."
